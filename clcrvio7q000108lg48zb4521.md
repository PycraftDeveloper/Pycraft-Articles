# Welcome to Pycraft on Hashnode!

Hello there everyone, and welcome to Hashnode, this site is going to be our replacement for Revue, which if you are unfamiliar will shut down on the 18th of January 2023.

We first learnt that Revue would shut down on the 14th of December 2022. From there we made plans to shut down our account there on the 1st of January 2023. Since then we have been researching and compiling a list of possible alternatives to replace Revue. Hashnode is the site that we found worked best for us and will, from the 8th of January 2023, be our replacement for Revue, and an alternative site for Dev and Medium.

On the subject, Revue was a site for us where we concentrated mainly on our weekly progress summaries, with Medium acting as our main site for hosting our longer-form articles. Dev acted as a central place where we would always share content from both Medium and Revue, as well as additional and behind-the-scenes content. This will all still take place, however, that content is no longer exclusive to Dev.

Our goal then for Hashnode is to take the place of Revue, but to also act more in the same way as Dev, where we also share exclusive content and behind the scenes going forward. The best way to share how this all fits together is through a table:

|  | Hashnode | Medium | Dev | Revue (since deleted) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Long form articles | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |  |
| Weekly progress updates | ✅ |  | ✅ | ✅ |
| Exclusive or behind the scenes content | ✅ |  | ✅ |  |

Now, it might be pretty immediately clear that we don't use Medium very much, this is because it is meant to be a paid site for both us and you, so we can only share three articles there a month, and also it is fairly restrictive in what you can do as a reader without a subscription. Pycraft is a free project for us to make, it is something that we have always and will always try to do, and should therefore be freely accessible.

With that in mind, we have decided to backtrack on one of our previous statements and also share historical articles from Dev/Medium here to make it easier to access those resources, and if other sites may get shut down, as something that we have always tried to do is make sure that we have at least two different places where we share the same style of content, just in case a situation like Revue were to happen again.

Please bear with us as well, we believe we have got the hang of everything here, but please give us a shout if something isn't right, or could be improved, and we are working on improving the formatting of articles we have transferred here from other sites!

Thanks for reading, we have been enjoying using Hashnode so far, it seems more intuitive and customisable than Revue had been, and it has the same level of polish as sites like Medium, and has perhaps a slightly nicer looking UI than Dev. (And also natively supports tables, something that overall we have found disappointing from other sites!)
